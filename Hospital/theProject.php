   <H1>TEWS: Triage Early Warning System </H1><br>
   <br>
   The hospital early warning system is designed to give administrative staff an early warning of those patients who are likely to need admission. 
   <br>
   The system works by gathering information taken at triage, performing analysis of this data and comparing it to historical admission data to give a probability of admission.
   <br><br>
   With each new patient being triaged, the data is saved and analysed to further improve the admission likelyhood engine. This snapshot of information will also provide valuable information about patient numbers, admission statistics and at risk groups. It will also allow us to refine our triage model to ensure the correct information is taken and saved as patients walk through the door.
   <br><br>
   The main aim of this system is that it will give an early warning to administrative staff about bed requirements and potential bottlenecks in patient flow. <br><br>
